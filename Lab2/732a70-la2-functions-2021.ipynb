An important skill is not only to be able to write code in the first place, but also to be able to figure where one would start looking for faults. This also involves being able to make the expectations we have on the program more explicit, and at the very least construct some sets of automatic \"sanity checks\" for the program. The latter will likely not be something done for every piece of code you write, but it is highly useful for code that might be reused or is hard to understand (due either to programming reasons, or because the underlying mathemetics is dense). When rewriting or optimising code, having such tests are also highly useful to provide hints that the changes haven't broken the code."
